A user can create ingredients to be added to their pantry.
<br />
They will be stored and organized by their category. Only a user with the email 'joshwebb42@gmail.com' (my email ;)) can add new categories.

When a user has at least one ingredient in their pantry they can navigate to the recipes tab where they will be given recipes based on what they have stored.  
<br />
The initial page gives the title, a picture and a graph showing what percentage of the required ingredients they have.

The recipe details page will present the user with all of that plus the serving size, cooktime, a complete list of ingredients with proportions, and the recipe step by step.
